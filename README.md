# ML-Algorithm (Unsupervised Learning)Hierarchical-Clustering
Clustering for the airlines data was performed to obtain optimum number of clusters.

>> Hierarchical-Clustering
1. The target variable is not available for segmentation problems and is hence known as unsupervised learning. The patterns and structures has to be figured out without a set outcome.
2. Here, for this dataset of east-west airlines, pre-processing is performed with normalisation and unwanted columns are dropped.
3. There are mainly two types of hierarchical clustering,
   > a. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
   > b. Divisive Hierarchical clustering
4. The distance between the centroids of these clusters is calculated and the points having the least distance are referred to as similar points and is merged, this is referred as distance-based algorithm. 
5. In hierarchical clustering, we have a concept called a proximity matrix. This stores the distances between each point.
6. Euclidean distance metric and complete linkage method is used for linkage calculation and is then applied in figuring out dendrograms.
